# Optimization-Techniques-Calculator
## Why we did this?
   * We were bored.
## How to use this
   * Download the code files as zip or git clone it (up to you).
   * Make sure you have atleast Python-3.10.0.
   * Also, do make sure you have python libraries such as [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) installed and        ready to use.
   * It's not necessary for you to know the concepts to use these calculators, however it is recommended that you do.
   * Some questions need derivatives and double derivatives. Use other online sources to find it, such as [derivative-calculator](https://www.derivative-calculator.net/)
   * This calculator was tested with various questions and the answers were pretty accurate (a lot of anomolies are to be expected).
   
## Getting a wrong answer?
   * Check the function you've entered into the source file.
   * Check the input values you've fed.
   * See if your questions specifies the number of iterations. 
   * See if your answer was obtained a few iterations prior.

## Updates
   * Added command-line args option to make it easier to use.
   * However, the input function string is only accepted in a python style syntax. For example: `x**2 + 10*x - 10` instead of `x^2 - 10x - 10` 
   
## Implementation 
   * The implementation example using command-line args is given below.

   * The implementation example using standard input is given below.

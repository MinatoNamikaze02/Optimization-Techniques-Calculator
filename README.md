# Optimization-Techniques-Calculator
## Why we did this?
   * We were bored.
## How to use this
   * Download the code files as zip or git clone it (up to you).
   * Make sure you have atleast Python-3.10.0 and gcc-11.2 installed.
   * Also, do make sure you have python libraries such as [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) installed and        ready to use.
   * It's not necessary for you to know the concepts to use these calculators, however it is recommended that you do.
   * We didn't take the time to make regex for parsing function as inputs, 
     hence *you have to edit your function in the source file*.
   * Some questions need derivatives and double derivatives. Use other online sources to find it, such as [derivative-calculator](https://www.derivative-calculator.net/)
   * This calculator was tested with various questions and the answers were pretty accurate (a lot of anomolies are to be expected.)
   
## Getting a wrong answer?
   * Check the function you've entered into the source file.
   * Check the input values you fed.
   * See if your questions specifies the number of iterations. 
   * See if your answer was obtained a few iterations prior.
 
## Final Notes
   * Use trigonometric functions using the numpy lib. 
        * (For example: np.sin(x) for sin(x))
   * For e(euler's number) add this line (from numpy import exp) and use it as follows.
        * (For exmaple: exp(x) corresponds to e^x)
